## Description

The objective of this project was to create an application that lets the user write notes and save them in a database. This application uses Express.js for the back end and retrieves the the saved data from a json file. 

When using the application, the user can click to view the details of previously saved notes or delete them, or they can add a new note and click the save icon to save the new note in the database. 

This application is deployed on Heroku (link included in Usage section).
